        <p>[2] Unzip the download package and if you are installing in a subfolder open the'.htacces' file with PLAIN text editor and find these 2 lines <br /><br />RewriteBase/<br />
ErrorDocument 500 /inv.php<br /><br />
        and after the slash (/) write the name of your subfolder (WITH a slash at the end)like so: <br />RewriteBase/foldername/<br />
ErrorDocument 500 /foldername/inv.php<br /><br />then upload the files to your host</p>
